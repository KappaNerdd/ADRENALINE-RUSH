Unfortunately, 'cause of this, she's unable to read or do activities that require visual feedback. However, she did decide to take up being a pianist; being self-taught by simply learning songs by ear. \nMain Design Inspiration: Kris Dreemurr (DELTARUNE) \nMain Character Inspiration: Cream the Rabbit (Sonic)";
