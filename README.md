# ADRENALINE RUSH is a (mostly) fast-paced, Sonic Rush trilogy 'n' Dragon Ball FighterZ-inspired game revolvin' around a boy, his adoptive family, and his group of friends havin' growin', unnatural powers.
(The game is in active development and bugs WILL be plentiful.)

This game is both a challenge for myself and a memorial to my cat, Saiyan, who passed away during development.

This game was made with [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en).

# GAMEPLAY

## OVERWORLD
Run around in the Overworld and interact with the people that live in the area, save through the game's save points; the GREAT TREES, collect Stickers or costumes for characters to either give you the edge or give you a different look, and continue the story of the game by going through its unique Stages.

## SPEED STAGES (Builds off the Overworld)
SPEED Stages are the Sonic Rush trilogy part of the game. Boost through the levels presented by the Stages, react to on-coming obstacles 'n' enemies, collect Trinkets, hit power-ups, get low times, get high scores, and get high ranks based on your time's rank and your score's rank.

## ACTION STAGES (Not implemented yet)
